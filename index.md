### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was my favorite because it was my first time ever learning how to code. Learning how to make a header was fun and cool to do. Also it was cool because it required talking to new people and team work. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 1, because we made patterns with loops. With this pattern we used dashes and bars and simple math to accomplish this pattern. Patterns are something I hae njoyed since I was a kid and it was pretty cool to make one with a code. 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12 part 1, was my favorite because we are making gifs! Since I was little I always wondered how gifs were made and here I am today making my very own gif. Also in this lab we are creating animations and generate random numbers.
